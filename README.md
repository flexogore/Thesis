# Thesis

1) You initialize the model in matlab (basicnet_edit)
2) File Chlamy.ipynb prepares all the required files to later compute the atomic mappings based on the working_model.xml you receive in the end
3) Then you calculate the mapping with run_rdt and unite_map, resulting mapping file is named all_mapping.C.sorted.txt
4) calvinbenson contains workflow for simulating MIDs and getting the differential matrix
